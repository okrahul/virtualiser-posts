# React + Vite

**Project Name: React Virtualizer**

---

## Description
React Virtualizer is a React application that utilizes various technologies to manage and display post data efficiently. It incorporates features such as fetching data from an API using Axios, state management with useQuery, implementing infinite scroll using useInfiniteQuery, and virtualization techniques using react-intersection-observer. The application also fetches specific post data using search parameters from URLs via React Router DOM.

The state management across the application is handled using Context API, which is divided into three contexts, making the application-optimized and easier to handle. Emphasis is put on creating a production-ready application, managing proper folder structure, and implementing a clear architecture for data updates and usage.

## Libraries Used
- useQuery: For data fetching and state management.
- React Router DOM: For navigation and handling URLs.
- react-intersection-observer: For implementing virtualization techniques.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
    https://github.com/yourusername/react-virtualizer.git](https://github.com/okrahul/virtualiser-posts.git)
   ```


2. Navigate into the project directory:

## Usage
1. Start the development server:
   ```
   yarn run dev
   ```
2. Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
